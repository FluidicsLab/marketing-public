Nanobubble EOR Screening

1.) Single Phase Injection 

Experimental Procedure
Inlet pressure sensor (0–10 bar range with high resolution)

Outlet pressure sensor (optional, but gives you ΔP directly)

Data logger or analog-to-digital interface

Syringe pump or backpressure-regulated gas/liquid drive



✅ Why Use Pressure Monitoring?
Metric	What It Tells You
Injection pressure	Resistance to entry; potential plugging
ΔP (inlet – outlet)	Flow resistance inside micromodel
Pressure evolution over time	Stability of flow, signs of jamming or blockage

🔁 Typical Injection Observations
Scenario	Interpretation
Constant ΔP at constant flow	Good injectivity, stable nanobubble behavior
Increasing ΔP over time	Plugging, bubble coalescence, or fouling
Spikes or oscillations in pressure	Intermittent blocking or bubble clustering
Much higher ΔP vs. control fluid	Flow resistance due to bubbles or viscosity
Lower ΔP than control	Possible slip flow, reduced drag (rare)

📊 What to Record
Parameter	Frequency	Notes
Inlet pressure (P₁)	1 Hz or better	During entire injection
Outlet pressure (P₂)	(if available)	Helps detect full ΔP
Flow rate	Fixed or ramped	Prefer constant for comparability
Fluid temperature	Optional but useful	
Time	Always log timestamps	

🔍 Analysis Options
ΔP vs. time plot: reveals flow stability

ΔP vs. cumulative volume injected: reveals threshold behavior

Compare ΔP curves between:

Brine

Nanobubble brine

Brine + surfactant (if used)



5. Pass/Fail Criteria
PASS: Stable pressure, smooth flow, bubbles present in effluent

FAIL: Plugging, unstable ΔP, flow exclusion, bubble collapse

monitor nanobubble stability under confinement

❌ Why You Can't Assume Pore Size = DLS Bubble Size
1. DLS Measures Hydrodynamic Diameter
It reports the average size in solution, weighted by intensity, not by number.

A small fraction of larger bubbles can dominate the DLS signal.

The actual nanobubble population often includes smaller and larger outliers.

→ DLS ≠ strict lower bound for penetrability

2. Pore Entry Requires More Than Size
Even if a bubble is smaller than a pore throat, it may:

Be deformed or compressed

Coalesce at the entry

Be blocked by surface charge, wettability, or clustering

→ Entry behavior is governed by interfacial physics, not just diameter.

3. Flow Conditions Differ
DLS is in bulk, stagnant fluid.

In porous media: shear, pressure gradients, and confinement drastically change bubble behavior.

→ Transport ≠ suspension behavior.

✅ What You Can Use DLS For
DLS Use	Valid?
Check if bubbles are still present at outlet	✅
Track size evolution over pressure steps	✅
Estimate if collapse occurred	✅
Predict penetration limit from size alone	❌

🧠 Smarter Use of DLS + Pressure
Use DLS as a binary signal: “Are bubbles reaching the outlet?”

Combine with pressure jump data to infer which zone blocks flow.

HPHT DLS would be great for this application!
